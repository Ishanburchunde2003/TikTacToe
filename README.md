# TikTacToe
 The Java code implements a console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game with a 3x3 grid. Players (user and computer) take turns marking cells ('X' and 'O'). The game ends when there's a winner or a draw. The computer's moves are random, and input validation is included. The program prints the board after each move, declaring the winner or draw at the end.
